## ⚙️ SQL Concepts Demonstrated

* ✔ Database normalization & relationships
* ✔ Joins (INNER, LEFT)
* ✔ Aggregations (`SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`)
* ✔ **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**
* ✔ **Window Functions** (`ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`, `LAG`)
* ✔ Date-based analysis (monthly trends)
* ✔ Store-wise profitability analysis
* ✔ Indexing & query performance tuning
* ✔ Stored procedures for automation
